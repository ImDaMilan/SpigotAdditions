# SpigotAdditions
An additional Spigot library aimed to be the dependency that saves developers time from pointless tasks and brings a bunch of useful utilities for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper developers to use!

Some of the great features of SpigotAdditions include:

 1. An Event Listener + Handler annotation that does everything for you!

    public static @Listener void onPlayerJoin(PlayerJoinEvent event) {  
    	  event.getPlayer().sendMessage("Hello!");  
    }
